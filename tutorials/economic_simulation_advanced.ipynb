    "# The Structure of Foundation + How to Extend It \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explain the low-level compositional structure of Foundation, the economic simulation. Its architecture stems from three main design goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexibility: e.g., it should be easy to create worlds with or without income taxes.\n",
    "2. Extensibility: adding new entities and components should follow an easy and transparent process.\n",
    "3. Simplicity: avoid deep class hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support these goals, Foundation modularizes the pieces of the simulation as much as possible. Below, we explain what these pieces actually are and how simulation environments are built from them. Understanding this structure will undoubtedly be useful when extending Foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation builds economic simulations using Scenario classes. Scenarios compose the simulation's constituent classes into an actual simulation environment. The majority of this tutorial is used to introduce the semantics of each such class type:\n",
