# Advanced Foundation: AI Economic Simulation Framework

This project is an implementation of the Foundation framework, a flexible, modular, and composable environment for **modeling socio-economic behaviors and dynamics in a society with both agents and governments**.

It provides a [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)-style API:
- `reset`: Resets the environment and returns the observation.
- `step`: Moves the environment one step forward, returning the tuple *(observation, reward, done, info)*.

The simulation framework can be used with reinforcement learning to learn optimal economic policies, as detailed in the following papers:

## Ethics Review and Intended Use
See our [Simulation Card](https://github.com/timipani/advanced-ai-economist/blob/master/Simulation_Card_Foundation_Economic_Simulation_Framework.pdf) for a review of the framework's intended use and ethical review.
