    """
    World containing spatially-segregated stone and wood with stochastic regeneration.

    For controlling how resource regeneration behavior...
        Coverage: if fraction, target fraction of total tiles; if integer, target number
            of tiles
        Regen Halfwidth: width of regen kernel = 1 + (2 * halfwidth); set >0 to create
            a spatial social dilemma
        Regen Weight: regen probability per tile counted by the regen kernel
        Max Health: how many resource units can populate a source block
        Clumpiness: degree to which resources are spatially clustered
        Gradient Steepness: degree to which stone/wood are restricted to the top/bottom
            of the map

    Args:
        planner_gets_spatial_obs (bool): Whether the planner agent receives spatial
            observations from the world.
        full_observability (bool): Whether the mobile agents' spatial observation
            includes the full world view or is instead an egocentric view.
        mobile_agent_observation_range (int): If not using full_observability,
            the spatial range (on each side of the agent) that is visible in the
            spatial observations.
        starting_wood_coverage (int, float): Target coverage of wood at t=0.
        wood_regen_halfwidth (int): Regen halfwidth for wood.
        wood_regen_weight (float): Regen weight for wood.
        wood_max_health (int): Max wood units per wood source tile.
        wood_clumpiness (float): Degree of wood clumping.
        starting_stone_coverage (int, float): Target coverage of stone at t=0.
        stone_regen_halfwidth (int): Regen halfwidth for stone.
        stone_regen_weight (float): Regen weight for stone.
        stone_max_health (int): Max stone units per stone source tile.
        stone_clumpiness (float): Degree of stone clumping.
        gradient_steepness (int, float): How steeply source tile probability falls
            off from the top/bottom of the map.
        checker_source_blocks (bool): Whether to space source tiles in a "checker"
            formation.
        starting_agent_coin (int, float): Amount of coin agents have at t=0. Defaults
            to zero coin.
        isoelastic_eta (float): Parameter controlling the shape of agent utility
            wrt coin endowment.
        energy_cost (float): Coefficient for converting labor to negative utility.
        energy_warmup_constant (float): Decay constant that controls the rate at which
            the effective energy cost is annealed from 0 to energy_cost. Set to 0
            (default) to disable annealing, meaning that the effective energy cost is
            always energy_cost. The units of the decay constant depend on the choice of
            energy_warmup_method.
        energy_warmup_method (str): How to schedule energy annealing (warmup). If
            "decay" (default), use the number of completed episodes. If "auto",
            use the number of timesteps where the average agent reward was positive.
        planner_reward_type (str): The type of reward used for the planner. Options
            are "coin_eq_times_productivity" (default),
            "inv_income_weighted_coin_endowment", and "inv_income_weighted_utility".
        mixing_weight_gini_vs_coin (float): Degree to which equality is ignored w/
            "coin_eq_times_productivity". Default is 0, which weights equality and
            productivity equally. If set to 1, only productivity is rewarded.
