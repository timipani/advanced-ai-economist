    Allows mobile agents to build house landmarks in the world using stone and wood,

    Can be configured to include heterogeneous building skill where agents earn
    different levels of income when building.

    Args:
        payment (int): Default amount of coin agents earn from building.
            Must be >= 0. Default is 10.
        payment_max_skill_multiplier (int): Maximum skill multiplier that an agent
            can sample. Must be >= 1. Default is 1.
        skill_dist (str): Distribution type for sampling skills. Default ("none")
            gives all agents identical skill equal to a multiplier of 1. "pareto" and
            "lognormal" sample skills from the associated distributions.
        build_labor (float): Labor cost associated with building a house.
            Must be >= 0. Default is 10.
